Mental Health and Well-being
Project Idea:

Mental Health Monitoring: The Mental Health Monitoring project aims to develop a machine learning model that analyzes digital footprints, such as mobile app usage, and other online activities, to detect early signs of mental health issues. By leveraging these digital traces, the system will provide timely interventions, offering support and resources to individuals before their conditions potentially worsen.
